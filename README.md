# Markovian Noise Modelling and Parameter Extraction of Superconducting Qubits

This repository contains the Python Jupyter Notebooks used in the data procurement for the recent research article: Brand, D., Sinayskiy, I. and Petruccione, F., 2022. Markovian Modelling and Calibration of IBMQ Transmon Qubits. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.04474.

All four notebooks here are similar in their structure, but specialised for various experimental procedures. The notebooks have the folliwng structure:

- Connection to IBM quantum computers and definitions of constants
- Creation of quantum circuits, backend execution of quantum circuits
- Error mitigation
- Plotting of results
- Numerical calculations
- Plotting of predicted results
- Optimisation of parameters
- Plotting of fitted results
- Hardware parameter extraction

The notebooks are interactive and can be run in any Jupyter server. They were created using Python 3.9.5, and all necessary packages are included in the requirements.txt file.
